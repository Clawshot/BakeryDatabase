# BakeryDatabase
The whole idea from this project comes from my parents' business. A local bakery in located in Honduras which was founded in 1993, almost 32 years ago. Unfortunately, its been getting behing in terms of technology so that made me think. What if, with my knowledge in CS, I created a system which would make the front end employees' work much mroe efficient. Being able to offer a renovated system for the business that my dad has worked for the majority of his life was something else.
